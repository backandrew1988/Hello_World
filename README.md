# Hello_World
Andrew Backs Coding Ideas &amp; Thoughts
just recentlygot into coding about 3 months. i've been studying Python3, Java, and PHP.
today i checked out Ruby and think it's GREAT i really love the simplicity of it.
i am going to jump into some JavaScript tomorrow along with my normal Python3 and add in some Ruby time.
